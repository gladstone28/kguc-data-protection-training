            <h2>Welcome to the KGUC Data Protection Hub.</h2>
            <p>Jamaica's Data Protection Act is a piece of legislation designed to protect the privacy and integrity of individuals' personal data. The Act outlines the duties and responsibilities of those who collect, process, store, and handle personal
                data, ensuring that this data is managed in a secure, lawful, and fair manner. It is aimed at giving individuals control over their personal information, including the right to access and correct data about themselves, and lays out the
                principles for data protection that are aligned with international standards, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union.</p>
            <p>The Data Protection Act in Jamaica establishes a framework for the protection of personal data within the context of the rights of individuals to privacy. It includes provisions for the processing of personal data, the rights of data subjects,
                the obligations of data controllers and processors, mechanisms for the reporting and handling of data breaches, and the establishment of a supervisory authority responsible for enforcing the law and handling complaints.</p>
            <p>The Act is part of Jamaica's efforts to modernize its legislative framework in response to the increasing digitization of society and the economy, and to facilitate safe electronic commerce, by ensuring that personal data is protected and
                that data subjects have rights and remedies available to them in case of misuse of their data.</p>
            <p><strong>This Training Hub was inspired by a presentaton done by Miss Lisa Rhooms(Managing Partner, Grant, Henry & Rhooms ) at the King's Gate United Church on Sunday 03 March 2024.</strong></p>
